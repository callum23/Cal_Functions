# Explanation:

How to calculate the mean, variance and 95% CI of the mean

# Data

```{r}
mean_value <- 10  # Mean of the distribution
sd_value <- 2     # Standard deviation of the distribution
sample_size <- 100  # Number of data points

# Generate random numbers from a normal distribution
data <- rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = mean_value, sd = sd_value)
```

# Calculate the mean

```{r}
mean_value <- mean(data)
cat("Mean:", mean_value, "\n")
```

# Calculate the variance

```{r}
variance_value <- var(data)
cat("Variance:", variance_value, "\n")
paste0("Variance of 0 means no deviation of variables away from the mean")
paste0("Variance of 100 means there is a large level of deviation of individual values away from the mean")
paste0("This essentially means in a bell shaped curve how big are the tails at either end and how high/steep is the mid point")
```

# Calculate 95% confidence interval

here we need to make sure that as we are using a t-test that the distribution of the data assumes a normal distribution, and for small sample sizes, it's appropriate for relatively symmetric datasets.

```{r}
confidence_interval <- t.test(data)$conf.int
cat("95% Confidence Interval:", confidence_interval[1], "-", confidence_interval[2], "\n")
paste0("(t-test so assuming a normal distribution and not for small sample sizes)")
paste0("The closer the values are to the mean the better, normally improves the greater the sample size")
paste0("95% CI are essentially how much wiggle room you have around the mean")
paste0("If two intervals of two means do not overlap i.e. lifespan of fish1 and fish2, then we can assume quickly that they are significantly different without any significance testing required.")
```
